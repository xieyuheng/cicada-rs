* Semantic

  - The direct semantic of De Bruijn notation,
    is stack based postfix programming language.

* Translating

  - Note that,
    I use `{...}` for De Bruijn's `(...)`,
    and `(let ...)` for De Bruijn's `[]`.

  - Suppose [ ] is a syntax translating function,
    which translate normal lambda notation to De Bruijn notation.

  - The rules :

    1. [ v ] => v

    2. [ (lambda (v) M) ] => (let v) [ M ]

    3. [ (M N) ] => {[ N ]} [ M ]

* Example

  - in De Bruijn notation :
    {M} {N} (let u) {P} (let v) (let w) {Q} z

  - which is equal to (for example) :
    {N} (let u) {P} (let v) {M} (let w) {Q} z

* Advantage

  - More equivalence between functions
    are explicitly revealed by the syntax.

  - Syntax A is better than syntax B,
    if, when using A, it is easier to manipulate
    the underlying semantics.

  - Or say, the semantics will be easier to imagine,
    when expressed in syntax A.
